# Q-Star (Q*) in Reinforcement Learning
*Author: Miquel Noguer i Alonso - Founder at AI Finance Institute*  
*Date: November 23, 2023*

#

## Q* is the currently accepted notation for the Optimal Action Value Function in RL. 

Q* RL algorithm might be using AI generated data (Logic + Maths) and teaches the LLM to solve multi-step logic problems. Q* might be applied to GPT-5, giving it excellent reasoning and retrieval skills.

#

## Reasoning

The biggest gains on reasoning come from strong reward models, as opposed to more SFT data or tools.

Much of (unpublished) research is now focused on finding a general planning algorithm for LLMs, i.e. some equivalent of the dlPFC. So PLANNING is the name of the game.

## Abstract
[Access this document](https://github.com/Quantum-Software-Development/Q-Star/blob/1e3dfd901f7ae1e9830f96f7e8c830cecbd5e804/Bellman%20Q*/Q*%20Bellman%20Doc.pdf) for a comprehensive overview of the Q-Star (Q*) concept in reinforcement learning, which delves into its mathematical formulation, significance, and the methods employed for approximation in learning algorithms.

In the literature we see two distinct methods
for training reward models: outcome supervision & process supervision.
